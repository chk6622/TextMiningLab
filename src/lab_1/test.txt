The Kiwi jihadi being held in a Syrian prison has told a reporter that if he returns to New Zealand, he is interested in setting up a medicinal cannabis company.

Mark Taylor also said he feels as if the New Zealand Government had stabbed him in the back.

Campbell MacDiarmid, a freelance journalist who spoke to Taylor recently, said although New Zealand would not be Taylor's first choice of countries to live in, he had thought about life here in the future.

"He said he was interested in starting a business and he had heard there was going to be a referendum on cannabis and he was interested in starting a medicinal cannabis company of some kind," MacDiarmid told RNZ.
If the legalisation of medicinal cannabis didn't occur through the referendum, MacDiarmid said Taylor was thinking of running a caf√©.

Taylor told MacDiarmid that he felt "stabbed in the back" by the Government because, apparently, he has been in touch with New Zealand intelligence which he said had urged him to leave Isis.

"One of the first things he asked me when I introduced myself as a New Zealand journalist was 'what's the New Zealand Government saying about me?'"
MacDiarmid told Taylor what Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters had said about him.

Ardern yesterday described Taylor as "our proble we might not like this problem, but he is still our problem".

Peters went further and said he had no sympathy for the man.
